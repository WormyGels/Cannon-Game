# Jeremy Wells - CS 396 - Project 4: Cannon Game
Created by Jeremy Wells for CS 396 at Western Kentucky University.

## TODO
* Menu
* Instantly go to next level on score reach and let them keep balls (maybe)
* Back to menu
* Better HUD
* Next level notifications
* Game over screen

## Bugs
* Target can disappear (I think despawn when going too fast)
* Occasional delay in sound (might be browser's fault)
